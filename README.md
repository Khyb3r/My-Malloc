# ðŸ§  Custom Malloc Implementation in C

My lightweight, educational implementation of **dynamic memory allocation** in C.  
This project implements `malloc` and `free` using a **free list structure**, **first-fit allocation algorithm**,
and **coalescing of free blocks**.
Feel free to create your own tests as I've not attached my testing script.
The inspiration behind this project came after reading the _Free-Space Management_ chapter from:
***Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces***
